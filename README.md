a helper header c++ library which enables python like lists in c++
This helper library enables python like lists in c++.
Necessity is the mother of invention. 
I needed something like lists in c++ for a project.
The closest solution was to use vector but vectors are strict in the datatypes they accept. 
So I made this library



# Usage
clone this repo and include the header file in your build dependency.
That's all

Has similar functions of list in python.
